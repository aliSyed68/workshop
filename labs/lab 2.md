# Lab 2

## Getting the code

* The project code is available on [RBC Enterprise Github] (https://rbcgithub.fg.rbc.com/kft0)

* We are going to `clone` this code repository on our workstations using Git we setup earlier. Cloning gets us a copy of an exisiting Git repository.
It is a smart way for developers and technicians to collaborate on work

* Run `git clone https://rbcgithub.fg.rbc.com/kft0`
